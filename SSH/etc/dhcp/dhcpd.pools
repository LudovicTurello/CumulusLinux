# This is the overall DHCP pool for the management network. If a device connects
# to the network and does not have a static address in dhcpd.hosts, it will be
# given an address in the pool (100-200 here). In this example, we give all
# devices in the subnet the same URLs for ONIE and ZTP, but you could specify
# individual URLs for each device in the dhcpd.hosts entries. We also specify
# this oob-mgmt-server (192.168.0.254) as the default gateway for all of the
# devices.
